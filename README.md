## My Learning Journey

For a deeper-dive into each area, head over to my online notes [myObsidian@Vercel](https://myobsidian.vercel.app/).

The overall flow is: 

_Writing / linking etc. in Obsidian > export as HTML pushes to Git > Git Actions build and push to Vercel > Vercel deployment build into live._

### Mini Git Task List

- [x] Create profile page README, write some initial content to help understand Git Markdown nuances.
- [ ] Understand new Git Issues and Projects offerings. Options, can/cannot, use-case etc.
- [ ] Decide on approach to an Anki learning system for my studies, SVC via a public/private repository.
- [ ] Look at connecting Git with the RITC Jira system. What would be the high-level flow - delineation of responsibilities (#1 goal - minimise rework. #2 goal - all designed admin work adds value).
- [ ] Identify candidate FOSS projects/apps to assist on.
